        <p>There may never be a clear winner in the battle between cat lovers and dog lovers over <br> which species is man’s best friend as they both have a large fan base for different reasons, <br> but there are several compelling arguments to be made for either pet-loving team. Here are <br> some of the arguments for both puppies and kittens in the <strong>Puppies Versus Kitten debate.</strong> </p>

        <h3>Kitten Versus Puppy: Which Is Better? </h3>
        <h4>Kittens Are Better Than Puppies</h4>
        <p>According to science, people who own kittens and cats are up to 40% less likely to die of a <br> heart attack than people who own other animals due to the stress relieving benefits of their <br> company that puppy owners don’t report receiving to the same degree. </p>
        
        <p>Here are <em>three </em> additional facts about kittens:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>They can be cheaper to own each year, whereas puppies cost more due to requiring <br> more toys, treats, food, and higher average bills at the veterinarian.</li>
        <li>They have a smaller carbon footprint than puppies considering they eat less meat, so <br> you can rest easy knowing that you are helping reduce the burden on both the <br> environment and the meat industry by owning a kitten.</li>
        <li>It was recently shown in a scientific article that people who are drawn to the <br> personality of kittens and become kitten owners tend to be more intelligent than puppy <br> owners.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Puppies Are Better Than Kittens</h4>
        <p>Puppies are great companions for people who need a service animal as certain breeds can <br> be big enough and strong enough to help other-abled people when they require physical <br> assistance. </p>

        <p>Here are additional facts about puppies:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Puppies are also known to develop higher understanding of commands than kittens, <br> making them much better behaved. As well, puppies provide immediate unconditional <br> love to their owners, while cats can take some time to warm up to their owners and <br> show their love in different ways.</li>
        <li>Puppies require a lot more attention and playtime from their owners, so they are <br> better-suited to more active people who are able to give their pet the attention and <br> exercise that they require.</li>
        </ol>

         <h3>So, Which Kind Of Pet Is Best For You?</h3>

         <p> Ultimately, it comes down to which kind of pet suits your lifestyle and what you are looking ,<br> for in a pet. Some people will get the most out of having a kitten, while others may get the <br> most out of having a puppy. </p>
         
         <p>If you are unsure which kind of pet is the best for you, write down what sort of needs you <br> have and take in to account your schedule and daily routine so you can budget your time <br> for your new pet. </p>

         <p>Puppies are a lot more demanding on their owners’ time, and require a lot more attention <br> and exercise each day. If you are able to accommodate a puppy, then you should look for <br> the breed that suits your lifestyle. If you are unable to accommodate a demanding schedule <br> of an animal, then a kitten might be best as they require minimal supervision and only some <br> entertainment each day.</p>
